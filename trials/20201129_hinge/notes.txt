   - Outcome

      - Great print, hinges fine and the overhang is ok
      - Internal radius is too small for expected plunger so change to 5mm radius and try again
      - Prints well no in smaller size
         - Key to have about 3 layer between piston fins and shaft fins to the hinge does not get stuck
      
      - Tight piston end - could be tighter
      - Cut half cylinder out of front - could be smaller
