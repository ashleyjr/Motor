      - 0.12 Layer Height (high
      - 100% infill 
 
   - Outcome

      - Good radius (2mm internal)
      - Goot wall thickness with 2 layers (0.8mm)
      - Lip crimbled so add in fillet
      - Notch for hooking wire
      - Some thing to wide

      - Prints well no, overhan gon the top is a bit steep so could bring that in
      - Will take  lot of wire to built up enough coil.

      - The rods are wider so open up internal radius and drop the grip as it will no fit in the drill
