   - Outcome

      - First print run failed, looks random, re-adjusted bed and started again
      - Bearings fell out on first turn, print was ok but too loose
      - Updated print reducing gap between bearings and rotor/house to 200um and also the diamter of the 
        pins to further lock in the cups
