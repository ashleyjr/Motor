      - Gap between roller and edges ~400um

   - Outcome

      - Rollers fell straight out - reduced gaps to 200um
      - Rollers tighter but still fell out 
         - Reduced torus around pin to leave a lip at the top/bottom
         - Increased gap to 300um
      - Much but but popped out while spinning
         - Keep gap at 300um 
         - Increase the lip
