      - 0.4mm nozzle
      - 0.12 Layer Height (high
      - 100% infill 
 
   - Outcome

      - Good radius (2mm internal)
      - Goot wall thickness with 2 layers (0.8mm)
      - Lip crimbled so add in fillet
      - Notch for hooking wire
      - Some thing to wide

      - Prints well no, overhan gon the top is a bit steep so could bring that in
      - Will take  lot of wire to built up enough coil.

      - The rods are wider so open up internal radius and drop the grip as it will no fit in the drill

      - Wire test with 0.7mm copper wires

         Test 1: 
            - 32.07V @ ~140mA
            - Therefore 230 ohms of wire 
            - Start to increase as it heat ups
            - FORCE: Small amount, enough to move the rod but not the piston

         Test 2:
            - 32.07V @ ~500mA
            - Therefore 64 ohms of wire 
            - Start to increase as it heat ups
            - FORCE: Larger than test 1 but still small

         Test 3:
            - A shorter piece of wire compacted in to one edge
            - No force at all

      - Reprint with extensions to lock in to top shaft
